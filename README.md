# Keylogger
A keylogger is a type of malware that records every keystroke that is made on a computer keyboard. This information can then be used to steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. Keyloggers can be installed on a computer through a variety of ways, including clicking on a malicious link, opening an infected attachment, or downloading a pirated software.

To create a Python based Keylogger your system must have Python installed (You can install Python from here "https://www.python.org/" and follow the installation process.

After installation you need to download a python library called as "pynput" using the pip command as "pip install pynput" (type in your CMD in Windows OS).

Here I created a GUI based Keylogger with the help of Python library named "pynput" and  framework called as "Tkinter"
The framework "Tkinter" provides tools and widgets to design windows, buttons, test boxes, and other GUI elements.
