# Keylogger
A keylogger is a type of malware that records every keystroke that is made on a computer keyboard. This information can then be used to steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. Keyloggers can be installed on a computer through a variety of ways, including clicking on a malicious link, opening an infected attachment, or downloading a pirated software.
